So this is the new blog since I'm not a pure windows developer any longer I thought it was time to
change to something new. So github.io pages are cheap and sane. Also, now that i'm doing ruby as well
as nodejs. Jekyll seemed like a great choice. 

I think its funny how things have gone full circle from simple html driven sites to complex data driven ones
to a really nice blend of the two ideas. This is why I love what I do.
